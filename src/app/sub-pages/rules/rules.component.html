            <h4 class="rules-header">Challenges</h4>
            <p class="rules-text">Player may issue a challenge up to 5 ranks ahead of them. You may not challenge the same person twice in a row, unless you are in the #2 spot, in which case there is only one possible person to challenge. However, the #2 spot must wait 3 days before challenging #1 again to give others the chance at the top. After approval, the challenge will be posted on the Fresno Gaming Community discord. It is the resposibility of both players to get their set in within one week of the posting of the challenge. If the match has not been played within this time, the challenge is nullified. If a player is inactive for three consecutive challenges, they will be dropped from the ladder, and if they wish to rejoin, will do so from the bottom. We reserve the right to grant exceptions to this penalty in the event someone has the bad luck to challenge three straight inactive players.</p>
            <p class="rules-text">Each player may have one incoming and one outgoing challenge at the same time. Should a player move up on their own challenge and then lose one sent in by someone else, the lower player will take the spot that had previously been held. For example Joe at #10 challenges Bob at #7. Bob at #7 challenges Mike at #5. Bob beats Mike, Moves to number #5, the two below him fall to #6 and #7. If Joe beats Bob, he will move to #7, NOT to #5.</p>
            <p class="rules-text">When you go to place a challenge, you will be given the option of challenging using the spot linked to your Google account, or to do so anonymously. All anonymous challenges must be approved first, whereas linked challenges post immediately.</p>
